# Platformer
A true platforming video game

Try to reach the end of the level without the ball hitting an obstacle or the game boundaries.
However, you must control the ball indirectly through the platform.

Rules:
If the ball hits an obstacle or the game boundaries, you will lose a life (3 total).
If the platform hits an obstacle, the platform will become smaller.
The platform can only move in the bottom half of the window.

How to play:
Use ARROW KEYS or WASD to move the platform
Use SPACEBAR to launch the ball from the platform
